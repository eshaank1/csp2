We plan to push and pull with github to share our work after communicating with the team to decide if what we're doing is what we want to have completed. We also plan to discuss ideas before following through with them and discussing the pros and cons of each idea. When we encounter any problems we will file an issue and have a dedicated member fix it. We also plan to implement AI to help us in the brainstorming and problem solving process which we will credit.
